    "In this exercise, we are going to explore some properties of discrete-time Markov chains. To do this, we'll define a custom state space and transition matrix, which contains the pairwise probabilities of transitioning between states. By default, our state space consists of two types of days - `Rainy` and `Sunny`. In the Rev language, we encode our states in a one-dimensional vector that we are calling `stateSpace`. We encode our transition matrix as a two-dimensional vector - a vector of vectors - called `transitionMatrix`. We also create a vector to hold the states of our chain, `myChain`, and provide one initial state (in this case, `Rainy`)."
