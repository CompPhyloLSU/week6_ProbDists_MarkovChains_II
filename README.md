## Assignment

Modify the code that we covered in class to simulate a discrete-time Markov chain in order to
simulate nucleotide evolution (four states - A,C,G,T) in a continuous-time Markov chain. You
can assume a Jukes-Cantor model of sequence evolution.

Pseudocode first! Use the example we walked through in class (see slides) as a guide to the steps
involved in simulation.
